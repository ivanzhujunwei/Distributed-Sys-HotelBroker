# Distributed-Sys-HotelBroker
A Hotel Booking Broker is an online system that allows users to search for, compare rates, check availability and make bookings at the hotels connected to the service in various cities throughout Australia. Note that, for the purpose of this assignment, the various hotels with the same name, but in different cities, are unrelated. So, for example, the Hilton Hotel in Melbourne is considered to be totally unrelated to the Hilton Hotel in Perth â€“ and so on. The system will require a complete separation of presentation from logical aspects, so you should develop a traditional client/server system.
